# SparkProject
This academix project aims to make us discover and manipulate Spark Server as well as Scala for data engineering by creating a sentiment analysis on social media X with Spark Streaming.

However, as direct data streams are now restrained on X (previously twitter) we had to do a sentiment analysis based on a tweet dataset already cleaned and prepared for such a job.
